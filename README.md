# vetwebapp-react
 **I would like this project to be a real application that is completely ready and will make people's lives easier. But since I am in the learning process right now, I am preparing projects to improve myself and I think I got what I wanted from this project.**
The aim of this project is to easily communicate with pet owners and veterinarians close to their place of residence through a social media. When a disease or suspicious situation is observed in the pet, it is uploaded to the platform as a post and other animal owners and veterinarians can see it. In fact, the idea, which should be in one-to-one communication style, was designed in this way as a result of technical problems. It was developed with React and the api I prepared specifically for this project was used.  You can check the backend repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/w1that/VetWebApp).
